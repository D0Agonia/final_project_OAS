      these terms will be available to relevant online services, and those
      additional terms become part of your agreement with the Institution if you
      use those online services.
    </p>

    <h2>Description of Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Institution provides you access to its online services, including its
      official Website (<a href="http://www.kld-edu.com">www.kld-edu.com</a>),
      portals (intranet and learning), social media channels, associated media,
      digital materials, online/electronic documentation, and Institution
      information (collectively referred to as "Services"). The Services, its
      updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new online
      service are subject to this Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are for your academic, non-profit and non-commercial use. KLD
      grants you conditional access to visit, browse, and interact with the
      Services as long as you abide with this Terms on your computers running
      validly licensed copies of software for which the Services were designed.
      The information including images and photos contained within the Services
      (“Information”) are provided by KLD and may be used for informational
      purposes only. You may not copy, modify, distribute, transmit, display,
      reproduce, publish, license, develop derivative/creative works from,
      transfer, or sell any Information, forms or documentation obtained from
      the Services. KLD and its associated symbols, consisting the logo and the
      typeface, should follow the standard. It must not be altered in any way,
      such as in layout, shape, font, font style, position or color. When
      written permission to reproduce materials is granted, KLD should be
      acknowledged as the source of the materials.
    </p>

    <h2>No Unlawful or Prohibited Use of the Services</h2>
    <p>
      As a condition of your use of the Services, you will not use the Services
      for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms, conditions,
      and notices. You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage,
      disable, overburden, or impair any KLD server, or the network(s) connected
      to any KLD server, or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment
      of any Services. You must not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any
      Services, other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to any
      KLD server or to any of the Services, through hacking, password mining or
      any other means...
    </p>


    <h2>Use of Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Services may contain e-mail feature, calendars, social media channels,
      document and communication management systems, and/or other message or
      communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with others
      (each referred to as "Communication Service" and collectively as
      "Communication Services"). You agree to use the Communication Services
      only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and,
      when applicable, related to the particular Communication Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Institution adheres to the basic principles of human decency, respect
      and values. We have zero tolerance for messages and comments that curse,
      trash, degrade, humiliate and intimidate. Such behavior does little to
      inspire intelligent and educated discussion. Freedom of speech does not
      mean license to smear reputation and ruin credibility. Nor does it mean
      the freedom to be irresponsible and to defame. Freedom of speech, rather,
      is the recognition of the right of anyone to speak his or her mind, and to
      express a contrary view without being objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of example, and not limited to the following, you agree that when
      you use the Communication Services, you will NOT:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the Communication Services in connection with surveys, junk email,
        spamming or any duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or
        otherwise);
      </li>
      <li>
        Defame, abuse, harass, insult, curse, stalk, threaten or otherwise
        violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of
        others;
      </li>
      <li>
        Disrespect the views of others. Some topics that are posted might be
        controversial or offensive to the sensibilities of some. If you feel
        strongly against such topics, you can practice courteous responses or
        report the concerned post to the Service Administrator. We don't want
        any mudslinging and flaming going on in the Services as it affects
        everyone;
      </li>
      <li>
        Publish, post, disclose, upload, distribute or disseminate any
        inappropriate, political, profane, defamatory, obscene, vulgar,
        inaccurate, harassing, hateful, threatening, indecent or unlawful topic,
        name, material or information;
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload, or otherwise make available, files or documents that contain
        images, photographs, software or other material protected by
        intellectual property laws, including, by way of example, and not
        limited to, copyright or trademark laws (or by rights of privacy or
        publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received
        all necessary consent to do the same;
      </li>
      <li>
        Use any material or information, including images or photographs, which
        are made available through the Services in any manner that infringes any
        copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right
        of any party;
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload files that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs,
        cancelbots, corrupted files, malware, ransomware or any other similar
        software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer
        or property of another;
      </li>
      <li>
        Advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business
        or commercial purpose;
      </li>
      <li>
        Download any file posted by another user of a Communication Service that
        you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally reproduced,
        displayed, performed, and/or distributed in such manner;
      </li>
      <li>
        Falsify or delete any copyright management information, such as author
        attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations
        or labels of the origin or source of software or other material
        contained in a file that is uploaded;
      </li>
      <li>
        Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the
        Communication Services;
      </li>
      <li>
        Violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable
        for any particular Communication Service;
      </li>
      <li>
        Harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail
        addresses;
      </li>
      <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations;</li>
      <li>
        Create a false identity for the purpose of misleading others and the
        Institution;
      </li>
      <li>
        Use, download or otherwise copy, or provide (whether or not for a fee)
        to a person or entity any directory of users of the Services or other
        user or usage information or any portion thereof; and
      </li></ul>
      <p>
        KLD, its developers and third-party providers have no obligation to
        monitor the Communication Services. However, KLD, its developers and
        third-party providers reserve the right to review materials posted to
        the Communication Services and to remove any materials (including, by
        way of example, and not limited to, posts and comments that violate
        standards of civility) in its sole discretion, without notice, for any
        reason whatsoever. KLD and third-party providers reserve the right to
        terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any
        time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        KLD reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as KLD
        deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
        process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove
        any information or materials, in whole or in part, in KLD's sole
        discretion, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable
        information about yourself, your family or your children in any
        Communication Services. KLD, its developers and third-party providers do
        not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any
        Communication Services and, therefore, KLD, its developers and
        third-party providers specifically disclaims any liability with regards
        to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your
        participation in any Communication Services. Site managers and hosts are
        not authorized KLD spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily
        reflect those of KLD.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials uploaded to the Communication Services may be subject to
        posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination; you are
        responsible for adhering to such limitations if you download the
        materials.
      </p>

<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Last updated: December 1, 2023</p>
<p>The Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Dasmariñas (“KLD” or “Institution”) provides you access to its online services, including its official Website (<a href="^1^">www.kld-edu.com</a>) social media channels, associated media, and Institution information (collectively referred to as "Services"). The Services, its updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new online service are subject to this privacy statement.
KLD is very much aware in protecting your privacy and personal information. This privacy statement discloses the data we collect from you and how we use it.
This privacy statement only applies to the Services. Other sites or apps that has a link from the Services may have a separate privacy statement.</p>

<h2>Collection of Personal Data</h2>
<p>KLD collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our Services. You provide some of this data directly, such as when you register for an entrance test/exam online, submit a search query to the KLD website, send us feedback online, upload media to the KLD Media Gallery, participate in the KLD Online Survey, purchase a book from the KLD Bookstore, sign up for KLD Web Mail or Office 365, or contact us for inquiries and technical support. We get some of it by recording how you interact with our Services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage data from Services running on your device.</p>
<p>We also obtain data from third parties. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this statement and any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These third-party sources vary over time, but have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social network when you grant permission to KLD Services to access your data on one or more networks,</li>
<li>Service providers that help us determine a location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your location,</li>
<li>Partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint research activities, and</li>
<li>Publicly-available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a service or feature, you may not be able to use the Services.</p>
<p>The data we collect depends on the Services you use, and can include the following:</p>

<p><strong>Name and contact information.</strong> We collect your first, middle and last name, and (if available) name prefixes and suffixes (based on your Philippine Statistics Office birth certificate), email address, postal and mailing address, phone and mobile number/s, and other similar contact information.</p>
    <p><strong>Credentials.</strong> We collect student numbers, passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.</p>
        <p><strong>Demographic data.</strong> We collect data about you such as your date of birth, age, sex, country, religion, written and spoken language/s, and occupation (if applicable).</p>
<strong>Device and Usage data.</strong> We collect data about your device and how you and your device interact with our Services. For example, we collect:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service use data.</strong> We collect data about the features you use, the items you purchase, and the web pages you visit inside the Services. This data includes your search queries or commands used in the Services.</li>
<li><strong>Device, connectivity and configuration data.</strong> We collect data about your device and the network you use to connect to the Services. This include data about the operating systems and other software used in accessing the Services, such as browsers. It also includes IP address, device identifiers, regional and language settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Error reports and performance data.</strong> We collect data about the performance of the Services and any problems you experience with it. This data helps us to diagnose problems in the Services you use, and to improve our Services and provide solutions. Depending on your product and settings, error reports can include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the Service related to an error, contents of the Service you were using when an error occurred, and data about other software on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Support Data.</strong> When you engage KLD for technical support, we collect data about you and your hardware, software, and other details related to the support incident. Such data includes contact or authentication data, the content of your message and other communications with KLD support, data about the condition of the machine and the application when the fault occurred and during diagnostics, and system data about software installations and hardware configurations.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<p>Third-party technologies. Third-party apps/services, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Office 365, etc., may collect data about your interests and favorites. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and favorites may also be inferred or derived from other data they collect. Third-party apps/services may collect data about your contacts and relationships if you use their services to manage contacts, or to communicate or interact with other people or organizations. As such, you must read their terms and privacy statement.</p>
<p>Physical appearance. If you enter the Institution premises or other facilities, your image may be captured by our security cameras. Furthermore, your recent photo may be required when registering for an entrance test or exam, and when applying for a KLD ID.</p>

<h2>Use of Personal Data</h1>

    <p>KLD uses the data we collect for three (3) fundamental purposes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To operate as a higher education institution (HEI) and provide (including improving and customizing) the services we offer,</li>
        <li>To send communication, including informative communication, and</li>
        <li>Promote the Institution, whether in our Services or in third-party services supported by advertising.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and customized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have safety measures designed to prevent certain data combinations. For example, when you are not yet authenticated (or not signed in), we store data we collect from you separately from any account information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or contact number).</p>

 
        <strong>Providing and Improving our Services:</strong> We use data to carry out your transactions with the Institution and to provide our Services to you.
        <strong>Technical Support:</strong> We use data to diagnose problems in the Services, repair the problem, and provide other customer care and support services.
        <strong>User Account Activation/Deactivation:</strong> We use data, including subscription and status identifiers, to activate/deactivate user accounts.
        <strong>Improvement of Services:</strong> We use data to continually improve our Services, including adding new capabilities or features.
        <strong>Security and Safety:</strong> We use data to protect the security and safety of our Services, detect and prevent fraud, confirm the validity of user accounts, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies. Our Services have the capability to identify abusive actions and may block the user and/or remove content if it violates our Terms.
        <strong>Institution Operations:</strong> We use data to make aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable the Institution to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our Services.
        <strong>Communications:</strong> We use data we collect to deliver and personalize our communication with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other means to inform or remind you of announcements and advisories that are specific to user types (student, alumni, applicant, faculty and/or employee).
        <strong>Advertising:</strong> Some of our Services are supported by advertising. We share the data we collect with third parties such as social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) so that they can select and deliver some of the ads you see on their sites and apps, as well as other sites and apps serviced by these solution providers.
 

    <h2>Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>The Services use cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sign-in and Authentication.</strong> When you sign into the Services or third-party providers using your KLD account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the Services without having to sign in again on each page.</li>
        <li><strong>Remembering your Preferences and Settings.</strong> Settings that enable our Services to operate properly or that maintain your preferences over time may be stored on your device. For example, if you signed in the Services, we may store encrypted session data in a cookie so that you will see the relevant information or services. These preferences and settings are placed in a cookie on your device until you clear browsing data using your Web browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest-Based Advertising.</strong> Third-party providers use cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that the provided ads are most relevant to you. You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third-party providers as described in their privacy statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics.</strong> In order to provide services, cookies and other identifiers are used to gather usage and performance data. For example, cookies are used to count the number of unique visitors to a Service and used as statistics about the operations of the Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition to the cookies set when you use Services, third-party providers may also set cookies when you use and/or interact with the Services.</p>

    <h2>User Account</h2>
    <p>With a user account, you can sign into the Services. Signing into your account enables access to specific services, permits you to access and use third-party services. When you sign into your account to access a Service, that is recorded and maintained. If you sign into a third-party service with your user account, you may be asked to consent to share the account data required by that service.</p>

    <p><strong>Creating and using your user account.</strong> When we create your school account, you will be asked for certain personal data and required documents as proof of your current status in KLD (currently enrolled), and a unique ID number will be generated to identify your account and associated information.</p>

    <p><strong>Signing in.</strong> When you sign into the Services, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the Service you signed into, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, your operating system and Web browser version.</p>

    <h2>Security of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>KLD is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>

    <h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The Institution retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have requested or may request in the future, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our commitments, legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly. The criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How long is the personal data needed to provide the services operated by the Institution? This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of those services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate academic, student, and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</li>
        <li>Is KLD subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the Philippines (or applicable jurisdiction for third-party providers), Government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of due process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collection of Data from Minors</h2>
    <p>The Institution collects data from applicants or users below 18 years of age, which is necessary to provide the Services (particularly for Junior and Senior High School).</p>

    <p>Their user account is treated much like any other account. The minor may have access to communication services like email, instant messaging, and online message boards and may be able to communicate freely with other users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Preview and Beta Releases</h2>
    <p>The Services offer preview, beta, or other pre-released versions and features ("Previews") to enable you to evaluate them while providing feedback, including performance and usage data, to the Institution or the third-party provider. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in the Services. If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the particular online service after general release.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>In our quest to uphold our commitment to protecting the privacy of your Personal Information, the Institution discloses its information practices, and to have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance. If you have questions regarding this statement, you can contact us by e-mail: <a href="mailto:admission.kld@gmail.com">admission.kld@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>We will update this privacy statement when necessary. When we make changes to this statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the statement. For material changes to the statement, or in how KLD will use personal data, we will post notifications on the KLD website and official KLD social media channels. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how the Institution is protecting your information.</p>


    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>The Institution welcomes your input and suggestions regarding this privacy statement, or if you have a data privacy concern or a question for the KLD Data Privacy Officer, please contact us by official social media accounts or e-mail.</p>
